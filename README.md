# Useful Async Algorithms

A collection of practical async algorithms and patterns for .NET.  
These techniques are especially helpful in **event-driven systems** where handling bursts of events, concurrency, and load distribution are key.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to provide **ready-to-use implementations** and **learning examples** of algorithms that are often overlooked in day-to-day development, but make a big difference in stability and performance.
